# hello-world
I am interested in the potential of library carpentries to enrich the learning experience. 
I look forward to a time when I am more proficient in the material.

In reviewing the lesson for clustering in Open Refine, I noticed that one of the objectives could be reworded for greater clarity.

The objective is:
"Use clustering to identify and fix replace varying forms of the same data with a single consistent value"

My suggested change is:
"Use clustering to identify and replace inconsistent forms of the same data with a single consistent value"
